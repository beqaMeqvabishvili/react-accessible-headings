# react-accessible-headings

## The Problem

[WCAG WAI says](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/),

> skipping heading ranks can be confusing and should be avoided where possible: Make sure that a `<h2>` is not followed directly by an `<h4>`, for example.

However developers often hardcode specific heading levels into their components, limiting their flexibility.

By using `react-accessible-headings` you can have components with dynamic headings that fit the appropriate heading level, allowing you to more easily create accessible headings that don't skip levels.

This library is less than 1 kilobyte (minified and compressed).

## Usage

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Level, H } from "react-accessible-headings";

export default function() {
  return (
    <div>
      <H>This will be a heading 1</H>
      <Level>
        <H>and this a Heading 2</H>
        <H>another Heading 2</H>
        <Level>
          <H>a Heading 3</H>
        </Level>
        <H>yet another Heading 2</H>
      </Level>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Usage with `offset`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Level, H } from "react-accessible-headings";

export default function() {
  return (
    <div>
      <H>This will be a heading 1</H>
      <Level>
        <H>This will be a heading 2</H>
        <H offset={1}>This will be a heading 3</H>
      </Level>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Exports

TypeScript is available.

### `Level` component

Props: _None_ except `children`.

This component doesn't render any HTML.

### `H` component

Props: `offset`: _(Optional)_ a **number** to offset the heading level. All other valid props for an heading are also accepted.

This component renders either `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, or `<h6>`. An exception will be thrown if attempting to render invalid HTML such as `<h7>` or greater.

### `LevelContext` context

If for some reason you'd like to inspect the current `level` value then `useContext(LevelContext)`.

## Limitations

While this library facilitates dynamic heading levels it doesn't detect skipped heading levels through incorrect usage such as,

```jsx
<Level>
  <Level>
    <H>this will be a heading 3</H>
  </Level>
</Level>
```

or,

```jsx
<H offset={2}>this will be a heading 3</H>
```

However testing in [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) will reveal such accessibility problems.

It's possible that in the future we may add this feature so please get in touch (by creating a Github issue) if you'd like to use this.

### Prior art

[DocBook](https://docbook.org/), the ill-fated [XHTML 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/mod-structural.html#sec_8.5.), and [HTML5's abandoned 'outline'](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2013/10/html5-document-outline/) had a similar idea.

> To facilitate navigation and understanding of overall document structure, authors should use headings that are properly nested (e.g., h1 followed by h2, h2 followed by h2 or h3, h3 followed by h3 or h4, etc.).

#### [Axe: Heading levels should only increase by one](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.4/heading-order)

> Ensure headings are in a logical order. For example, check that all headings are marked with `h1` through `h6` elements and that these are ordered hierarchically. For example, the heading level following an `h1` element should be an `h2` element, not an `h3` element.
